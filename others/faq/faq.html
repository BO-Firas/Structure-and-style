            <div>
                <h3>Who are the couriers?</h3>
                <p>Couriers are independent professionals connected to our platform. Together with a smartphone and their own vehicle, they're eager to help you with your tasks as quickly and effectively as possible.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>How do I place an order?</h3>
                <p>Ordering your first Need For Delivery is really easy. Just follow these steps:
                    (1) Go to the "Manage payment methods" section in your profile and add a debit/credit card.
                    (2) Go back to the main screen and set the delivery address. Remember to choose the correct city from the drop-down menu.
                    If you have a promo code, don't forget to validate it in your profile before ordering.
                    
                    Now you have 3 options:
                    (1) Buy something: from a restaurant or store. Choose from any of our partners in any of the categories.
                    (2) Send something: with just a pick-up point and destination, you can use a courier to send anything.
                    (3) Ask for something (Anything): describe anything you need and Need For Delivery will try to make it happen!
                    Follow the steps required for each option and once you're finished, a courier will accept your order and deliver it in minutes.
                    If you need to add more than one delivery address, you'll need to place the order on our website.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>How much does delivery cost?
                </h3>
                <p>The price of our service is optimised by distance, so the closer it is, the cheaper it is.

                    If you use the "Courier” or "Anything” category, the app calculates the distance between the pick-up point and delivery address, and only shows the total delivery cost.
                    For "Anything” orders, once the courier has bought the item, you'll know the total cost of the service.
                    
                    If you're ordering from one of the stores available on the app, you can see the item's price beforehand. There will be a pre-established delivery cost depending on our agreement with the store in question, which you can see by clicking on the store. So before you confirm the order, you'll know the total cost of the service.
                    Occasionally, the price of the product may differ to what is shown on the app. If the price difference is less than 30%, Need For Delivery will automatically proceed to buy the products for you. You'll be able to see the updated price once the courier uploads the receipt of the purchase.
                    However, if the difference in price is over 30%, the courier will contact you to ask if you'd still like to proceed with the purchase. (For night deliveries, there might be an extra service charge applied to each item's price. The amount applied depends on the city and store, and you'll see this surcharge when you're at the checkout stage in the app.)</p>

                <p>Our couriers use motorcycles or bikes so they can carry whatever you want, as long as it's under 9 kg in weight (3-4 shopping bags in volume) and fits in a box sized 40x40x30 cm. Need For Delivery is happy to transport anything you need bearing these dimensions in mind.</p>

                <h3>Do you transport animals?</h3>
                <p>While we'd love to deliver your beloved cat or newt, this isn't something we offer at the moment. Maybe someday in the future...</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>I want to return a product. What do I do?</h3>
                <p>We connect your orders to couriers; they make the purchase in your name, so you continue being the purchaser and final user. Any returns or complaints about products should be made directly to the establishment. (Except for, in the specific case of orders placed on the Platform through the drop-down menu of McDonald's products, the customer should contact Need For Delivery directly.)</p>
